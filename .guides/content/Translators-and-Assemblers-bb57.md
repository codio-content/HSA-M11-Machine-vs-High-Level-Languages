## Translators
If you recall, the CPU of a computer can only understand programs written in machine language and programs written in any other language must be translated into machine code.  This is the role of a translator â€“ just as Chinese has to be translated into English for most of us to understand, the translator translates assembly languages into machine language that the CPU can understand and execute.

A **translator** is required to translate the assembly language into machine language. This translator program is called the **assembler**.  A computer language translator is a program that translates a set of code written in one programming language into a functional equivalent of the code in another programming language. 

## Assemblers
An assembler is a program that takes basic computer instructions and converts them into a pattern of bits(0's and 1's) that the computer's processor can use to perform its basic operations. Some people call these instructions assembler language and others use the term assembly language.
An assembler performs the translation process in similar way as compiler. But assembler is the translator program for assembly language (a low level programming language), while a compiler is the translator program for high level programming language. We will learn more about compilers later in the unit.
