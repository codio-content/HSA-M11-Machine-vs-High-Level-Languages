# Recall

A **program** is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do in order to come up with a solution to a particular problem. Programs are written using a programming language. A **programming language** is a formal language designed to communicate instructions to a computer.

In this lesson we will look at different levels of programming languages, the purpose of translators and the characteristics of an assembler, a compiler and an interpreter.

## Levels of programs:
There are two major types or levels of programming languages: **low-level languages** (machine and assembly) and **high-level languages**. Examples of each are shown below:

### High-level Language 
    class Triangle {
    .....
    float surface ()
       return b*h/2
    }

### Assembly Language
    LOAD r1,b
    LOAD r2,h
    MUL r1,r2
    DIV r1,#2
    RET

### Machine Language
    line 1 of code
    0001000100010010101
    0010010011101100111
    1010110100110......
