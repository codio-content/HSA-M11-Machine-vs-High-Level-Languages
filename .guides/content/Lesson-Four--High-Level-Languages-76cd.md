The programming language you will be learning is Python. Python is an example of a high-level language; other languages you might have heard of are C++, Java, Pascal, BASIC and C#.  High level languages use natural language elements, and more closely resemble a human language. Such languages are considered high-level because they are closer to human languages and further from machine languages. In contrast, assembly languages are considered low-level because they are very close to machine languages. The main advantage of high-level languages over low-level languages is that they are easier to read, write, and maintain. 

### Hello World Example Program
The Hello World program written in Python is shown to the left. When we run the program, the text **Hello, World!** is printed. 

{Run}(python3 Hello-World.py)


Compared to the previous examples in low-level languages, it is clear that one of the primary advantages of writing programs in high-level languages such as Python is that these programs are easier to read.  There are however, numerous advantages of both.

#### Advantages of writing programs in high level languages:

- It is less time consuming to write, test and debug the program and so there is faster program development.
- It is not necessary to remember all of the CPU registers or mnemonic instructions.
- Portability of a program from one machine to other as most high-level languages are generally portable across different CPUs unlike low level languages

#### Advantages of writing programs in low level languages:

- They require less memory and have a faster execution time
- Allow programmer to directly control system hardware and are used extensively for programming embedded systems


High level languages provide built-in data structures and constructs such as selection (if…then) and iteration (while…endwhile) and have libraries of functions that programmers can use instead of having to write them all themselves. These characteristics are the reason that programmers typically choose a high level language to build their programs.

A vast number of different high-level languages are available, such as Python, Java, C and Visual Basic, and most programs are written in high level languages.  These languages are at a higher level of abstraction from the actual computer hardware (hence high level languages) and focus more on the programming logic rather than using the underlying hardware components such as memory addressing.

The high level language gets compiled by a compiler and then gets converted into machine language which is easily understood by the computer.
