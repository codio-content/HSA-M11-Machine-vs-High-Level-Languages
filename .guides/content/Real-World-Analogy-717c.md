## Real-world analogy: 
Let's consider this example of translating a speech from one language to another.

When translating a speech from the Chinese language into the English language, an interpreter can be used provide a real-time translation. As the interpreter hears a phrase, he/she translates, and immediately speaks the translation.
- ADVANTAGE: the translation is immediate
- DISADVANTAGE: if you want to hear the speech again, must interpret all over again

In the same scenerio, a translator (or compiler) translates the entire speech offline. The translator takes a copy of the speech in the Chinese language, and then returns when the entire speech is translated into the English language.
- ADVANTAGE: once translated, it can be read over and over very quickly
- DISADVANTAGE: must wait for the entire speech to be translated
