There are two main ways to convert or translate programs: compiled vs interpreted. Luckily, it’s not a decision we have to worry about. But it is worth knowing difference; however, don’t get too bogged down in the details.


Compiled languages are when a person writes the code, compiler separates the file and the end result is an executable file. Basically, owner keeps the source code.

Interpreted languages are different because the code is not compiled first hand. Instead, a copy is given to another machine and that machine interprets it. An example is JavaScript (which is used everywhere online).

The main advantage of interpreter is that it makes easier to detect and correct errors in the source program.  It is a time consuming process of translating and executing statements one by one.  Each time the program is run, the source code is translated again. 


This table shows the pros and cons of each. 

| Compiled | | Interpreted | |
| :-------: | :----------: | :---------- | :----------: |
| Pros | Cons | Pros | Cons |
|ready to run| **not** cross platform | cross-platform | interpreter required |
|often **faster** | inflexible | simpler to test | often **slower** |
source code is **private** | extra step | easier to debug | source code is **public** |
