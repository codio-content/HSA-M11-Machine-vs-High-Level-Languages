**Assembly language** is also a low-level language and although the instructions are not identical, they are very similar to machine code.  Each instruction in assembly language is directly equivalent to one in machine code.

Many of the earliest computer programs were written in assembly languages. Most programmers today don't use assembly languages very often, but they are still used for applications like operating systems and other technical applications, which use very precise timing or optimization of computer resources. While easier to read than machine code, assembly languages are still pretty difficult to understand. This is why high-level languages were developed.

Assembly language is the first step to make machine language more understandable and readable by humans.  It is difficult for humans to think and write programs in pure machine code using 1s and 0s. Assembly language uses words called mnemonics to replace the commands represented as strings of 1s and 0s.  

For example LOAD, ADD and STO are mnemonics used to represent the binary commands to load numbers into the accumulator, add numbers and store them in the memory location indicated by the operand.
