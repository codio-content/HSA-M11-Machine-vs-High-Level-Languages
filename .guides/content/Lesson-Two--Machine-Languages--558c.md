There is only one language that the CPU of a computer can understand without translation and that is **machine language**.  Machine language does not need to be translated. 
However, programmers almost never write programs directly in machine code, because it requires attention to numerous details that a high-level language handles automatically. Furthermore, it requires memorizing or looking up numerical codes for every instruction and is extremely difficult to modify.

In machine language, all programs must be presented to the CPU in that language which has only two characters, 1 and 0, the digits of the binary system. The entire program is written using only 0's and 1's. 

You will learn much more about binary in the next module :)

An example of what a set of program instructions in binary might look like is: 

  
    00000000111010000011110000000000111111000000
    11110000000110010100000110000011110010001100
    00000011100100011100000011110010101000011101
    01010111000001110001110001111000000010101010
    
Machine language is the native binary language (comprised of only two characters: 0 and 1) of the computer and is difficult to be read and understood by humans. Programmers commonly use more English-like languages (called high level languages) such as Basic, C, Java, etc., to write programs which are then translated into machine language (called a low level language) by an assembler, compiler, or interpreter.

In machine language, "00000010" might mean "Turn light off," while "00001000" might mean "Brighten light by 10 percent." Examples of machine language vary from machine to machine, but all are numeric instructions that tell a machine what operation to perform. 

- All the instructions that the CPU has to execute are strings of 1s and 0s. 
- The CPU interprets the strings of binary digits as instructions and data. 
- Each type of microprocessor has a fixed number of commands that it can understand. These make up the CPUâ€™s **instruction set** and they are different for the different types of microprocessor. 
- A program written in machine code for one type of CPU would not work on a different one.  
- Machine code is referred to as a **low level language**.
